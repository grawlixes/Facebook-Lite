# Facebook-Lite
A fun C++ project focusing on dynamic data allocation. I'm like the open-source Mark Zuckerberg.

I will update this program if issues are brought to my attention, but I will not be looking at it much myself because I've finished it. I know there are memory leaks that should be dealt with, but they're not my priority at the moment.
